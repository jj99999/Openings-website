                <h3>Jimmy Creech, LGBTQ Advocate, Former United Methodist Minister</h3>
                <p><b>Friday, October 19, 2012</b></p>
                <p>Washington Street United Methodist Church, Columbia</p>
                <br>
                <p>Author of <i>Adam's Gift: A Memoir of a Pastor's Calling to Defy the Church's Persecution of Lesbians and Gays</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>A native of Goldsboro, North Carolina, Jimmy Creech was an ordained elder in The United Methodist Church from 1970 to 1999 when the Church removed his ordination after two church trials for his officiating at a wedding ceremony of a gay couple. In April 2011, his book, <i>Adam’s Gift: A Memoir of a Pastor’s Calling to Defy the Church’s Persecution of Lesbians and Gays</i>, was published. <i>Adam’s Gift</i> is Creech’s inspiring first-person account of how a conversation with a gay longtime parishioner Adam transformed his life and ministry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since The United Methodist Church removed his ordination in 1999, Creech has worked with many social-action organizations, including <a href="http://www.soulforce.org/">Soulforce</a>, an interfaith movement confronting spiritual violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality, dedicated to defeating an anti-gay marriage amendment to the NC State constitution and to advocating for marriage equality; and <a href="http://www.faithinamerica.org/">Faith In America</a>, an organization working to end religion-based bigotry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Creech has received the Flagbearer Award from PFLAG National; the Human Rights Campaign Equality Award; the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Frank Porter Graham Award; the North Carolina Pride, Inc. Award; and the Lee and Mae Ball Award, presented by The Methodist Federation for Social Action. He was selected as one of OUT magazine’s “Out 100” in 1998 and 1999. He now lives in Raleigh where he recently helped to found the North Carolina Social Justice Project.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Don't Ask, Don't Tell is history, yet full LGBTQ military equality has not been achieved. South Carolina native Zeke Stokes, Communications Director for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network - a leading national organization that fought for and won repeal - discussed the impact of repeal, why LGBTQ service members still are not equal, and what's next in the fight for full equality in the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before joining SLDN, Zeke managed his own firm, consulting for a variety of political, nonprofit, corporate and governmental clients in the areas of public relations, development, and communications, including the South Carolina Department of Education, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and a variety of campaigns at the local, state, and federal level. He is a former publicist for the March of Dimes national office in White Plains, NY, and is a native of South Carolina, where he began his career at age 19 as the youngest Director of Communications for a State Democratic Party in the country.</p>
