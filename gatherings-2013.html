                <h3>Of Faith and Hope</h3>
                <p><b>Tuesday, November 26, 2013</b></p>
                <p>St. Martin's-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church, Columbia</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sheila Morris, Author/Activist/Humorist</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sheila was born and raised in rural Grimes County, Texas, and is a first-year Baby Boomer. She is a cum laude graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and has a master’s degree with honors from The University of South Carolina in Columbia. She comes from six generations of Southern Baptists and did graduate studies for two years at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. Later she served as a minister of music in several churches during her early years in South Carolina prior to the inevitable severing of her ties to that part of her heritage as a result of her activism.</p>
                <br>
                <p>She has overcome, and moved on. Her career as a CPA, college accounting instructor, stockbroker, and financial advisor spanned four decades and three states including two years in Seattle, Washington. She received numerous awards for outstanding performance in the corporate world and retired with remarkably little fanfare from her position as vice-president of investments with a major financial services firm in 2008. She currently shares a nomadic life with her partner Teresa Williams and their three dogs as they keep the interstates and back roads busy between their homes in Columbia, South Carolina and Montgomery, Texas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sheila has spent a lifetime of community involvement in actively promoting social justice issues. In the early 1970's she was a member of the National Organization for Women and worked tirelessly as a volunteer in support of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment which was ultimately defeated. She also served as a volunteer treasurer for Planned Parenthood in Columbia and in that same capacity for the Advocates for Women on Boards and Commissions. She was a volunteer for the Sickle Cell Foundation in South Carolina. In the late 1980's and early 90's Sheila began her work for the LGBTQ community by serving on the boards of Palmetto AIDS Life Support Services in Columbia and the AIDS Benefit Foundation of South Carolina.</p>
                <br>
                <p>She was a co-founder in 1993 of the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Business Guild and served as its first President and has remained involved with that organization in various roles for the past twenty years. She was given the Founders’ Award and various other awards by the Guild during that time. On the national level Sheila served on the board of directors for the Victory Fund and was recognized by the Human Rights Campaign with its prestigious Community Service Award for her pioneering work for the LGBTQ community in South Carolina.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Born and raised on a rice and soybean farm in rural Arkansas, Ed is now a poet, political activist, and associate professor of English and Women's Studies at the University of South Carolina. He got his B.A. from Harding University and received his Ph.D. in literature from the University of Texas, Austin. Ed is president of the American Conference of Irish Studies, Southern Region. He has been secretary, vice president, and president of the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ed is the author of <i>Signals</i>, winner of the 2007 South Carolina Poetry Book Prize; <i>Prodigal: Variations</i>; and <i>Nest</i>. He is also the co-editor with Candace Chellew-Hodge of <i>Out Loud: The Best of Rainbow Radio</i>, a collection of radio essays that was selected by USC-Upstate for their 2013 first-year common reading. His work has appeared in <i>Best New Poets 2007</i>, <i>The Book of Irish American Poetry</i>, and <i>Collective Brightness</i>.</p>
